Anteus and Galiaph represent strength and power. am I able to defy such strength ?
I'll try, as much as I can. I'm starving for money and life, so I won't give up any soon. Seneca said that even

Antique one.

# Enough for philosophical prelude. What's on todays agenda ?
No algorithms for now. Tajik and base HSJ stack for now.
16 web templates. I'll do every one of them. Maybe, I should try to add one personal flavour for each one of them.

# TODO:
- Website
- Ironing
- Retyping
- Orosta ?

- Automate creating front-end project
